									<h2><a href="#">About<br />
													Me</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Salim Hadi Salim, and I'm a grade 11 highschool student aspiring to be a software engineer. Ever since I entered highschool I've been at a loss for what I want to do with my future as I felt like I was in a rush to decide. My father is an entrepreneur, an engineer, he has always pushed me to do coding despite me not wanting to. I never really liked it in the past at all. Whilst taking computer science throughout my highschool years I have found myself more and more intrigued by coding. I found it really cool how you could learn something, teach that to your computer, and literally just immerse yourself in a completely different world.

										<h2><a href="#">Intro to<br />
										Javascript</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was the first real module I actually decided to start with. When doing this module I learned to code with the basics of Javascript. Javascript is an interesting language in the sense that it's versatile and easier to utilize the most. This made learning the basics of Javascript very entertaining for me. The Intro to JS module also allowed me to lead into other modules such as Natural Simulations and Games and Visualizations.

										<h2><a href="#">HTML & <br />
										CSS</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>HTML and CSS is what I believe to be one of the most important coding languages. You use it to code internet web pages, HTML and CSS quite literally is the forefront of the internet. In the past i’ve tried to learn how to code with it but I never really put much effort into it. Doing it as of recently to code my portfolio and literally just learning it with this module really put into perspective how simple it can be and how simple it can be to code with it.

										<h2><a href="#">Games <br />
											& Visualizations</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Games and Visualization is one of my favorite modules as it really brought my dreams to reality. Despite it being short I could honestly say it was one of the most entertaining for me. With my dreams and aspirations to being a software engineer it really showed me somewhat what it would be like to be a game dev.

										<h2><a href="#">Natural<br />
										Simulations</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Natural Simulations was the last of the three Javascript modules that I coded in. This one was honestly really not entertaining for me at all, it felt really long and gruelling and it was quite challenging for me. Within this module there were quite a few modules that only really took a few minutes to do (like 2-4). But then there were some that were so hard that I literally just gave up on them, if we were in school I would’ve asked for help.

										<h2><a href="#">Programming<br />
										(Pseudocode)</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was the first module I did throughout the first few months of the course. It had an abundance of quizzes, challenges, and lessons within it. This module was the hardest out of all of the AP CSP modules by far. Pseudocode was honestly a hard concept for me to understand, it really made it difficult to complete this module but I did end up getting through it. All in all I believe that this module brought me something that will possibly be a useful skill for me in the future.

										<h2><a href="#">Computing Innovation<br />
										and The Internet</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>These two modules taught me a lot about internet protocols and computing innovations. Within the internet subsection students learned all about multiple sorts of internet protocols. The computer innovation module is all about the creations of the internet, things such as social media, open platforms, and even email communications. It was a pretty simple module for me, I understood almost everything from the start due to the fact that I use social media and online networking all the time. The internet module was the absolute longest module (out of the computing modules) due to the fact that I was learning a completely new subject that actually confused me somewhat, but after awhile it really kind of stuck with me, now I can tell anyone the difference between bitrate, bandwidth, and latency.

										<h2><a href="#">Digital Information<br />
										and Algorithms</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The digital information module taught me about things such as bits and bytes and it even explained data compression to me. The module was very interesting in the sense that it taught me about the details of my computer that I could honestly say I didn’t know prior to doing it. The algorithms module on the other hand was short and sweet, it taught me about flow charts and how to calculate the efficiency of algorithms.

										<h2><a href="#">Simulations, Data Analysis, <br />
										and Online Data Security</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>These were honestly the most tedious set of subsections I had to do for a module. The simulations subsection taught me about literally running simulations within computing. The data analysis subsection taught me how to read and understand data sets and also how to recognize biases in machine learning. The online data security subsection really made me understand the true meaning of online security and how important it is to be safe online. Out of all of these subsections I feel like the online data security subsection taught me the most important information, it taught me about things such as encryption, cyber attacks, and even user data tracking online (cookies, history, and geolocation).
